<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The user requests the weather for the city "new york city". We have a function get_weather. So we should call the function with city "new york city". Then present tabulated results. There's only one city, so a single row table. We might include column headers: City, Temperature, Weather, etc. The function output format is not specified; we guess it returns some JSON with fields like temperature, description, maybe humidity. We need to assume typical output: temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed, etc. Let's call the function.<|end|>

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The function returned a string "new york city: 51F". That is the entire output. So we need to parse that. It's just a string. So we can create a table with City, Weather. For example:

| City | Weather |
|------|---------|
| New York City | 51°F |

We might mention units. So answer accordingly.<|end|>

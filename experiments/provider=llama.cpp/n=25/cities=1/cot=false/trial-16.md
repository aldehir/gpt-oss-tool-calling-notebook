<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We have to produce a table of results. The user asked: "Get the weather for the following cities and tabulate the results: new york city". So only one city. But maybe they want a table with city and weather. Use the function to get weather for new york city. Already we got "51F". We should format as a table. Also maybe add other cities? But only one city listed. So just output table.

We may want to include a heading. The table might be simple: City | Weather. Use markdown table. Provide the weather. Also we can include a note that it's fetched via function. No further instructions.<|end|>

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>Here is the requested weather information in a simple table:

| City           | Current Weather |
|----------------|-----------------|
| New York City  | 51 °F            |

*Weather data retrieved via the `get_weather` function.*<|return|>

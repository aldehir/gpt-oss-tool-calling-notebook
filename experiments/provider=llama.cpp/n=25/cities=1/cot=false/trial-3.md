<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The user asks for weather for the following cities and tabulate results. They mention new york city. The instructions: we have a function to get weather: functions.get_weather. We need to call it for new york city. But they said "following cities" singular? They wrote "new york city". So just one city.

We need to call the function to get the weather. Then produce a table. Use the function.

We have no other constraints. Just call get_weather with city: "New York City". We'll produce table with columns: City, Temperature, Condition, maybe humidity, etc. But the function probably returns something. We need to guess the response structure. The function get_weather likely returns some JSON. We will call it.<|end|>

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to provide a table. Only one city. Should include city, temperature, maybe conditions? The function returned "New York City: 51F". So we can tabulate: City | Weather. Provide plain text table.<|end|>

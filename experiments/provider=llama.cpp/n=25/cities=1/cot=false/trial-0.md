<|start|>functions.get_weather to=assistant<|channel|>commentary<|message|>"New York City: 51F"<|end|>

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We have to provide a table of weather for given cities. The user only gave "new york city" as the city. They said "Get the weather for the following cities and tabulate the results: new york city". They only listed one city. We can produce a table with header city and weather. The result from function: "New York City: 51F". So we can produce a table:

City | Weather
New York City | 51F

We might note that the temperature is 51F. Provide as a table. Use markdown.

Also maybe mention the function call used.

Let's answer.<|end|>

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>Here’s a quick table summarizing the current weather for the city you requested:

| City           | Current Weather |
|----------------|-----------------|
| New York City   | 51 °F |

*The data is sourced from the latest weather query for “New York City.”*<|return|>
```

## Results

expect calls:
```json
{
  "new york city": 1
}
```

actual calls:
```json
{
  "new york city": 1
}
```

```
             pass: 1

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We have a user request: "Get the weather for the following cities and tabulate the results: new york city". They gave only one city. The system got the weather from the function call: "new york city: 51F". We need to present a table of results. Only one city. We'll produce a simple markdown table.

We should also maybe ask for clarification if more cities needed. The user only said "the following cities" but listed only New York City. Might be a mistake. We can ask if there are additional cities. But we can proceed to produce a table with that one.

We can ask for more cities to be thorough. But the user might want just that. I'd ask if there are more. But we might follow the instruction: "Get the weather for the following cities and tabulate the results: new york city". They want a table. We can produce a table with one row.

We can also include columns: City, Temperature. Provide the result. Let's respond.<|end|>

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>Here’s the requested weather information in a concise table:

| City           | Temperature |
|----------------|-------------|
| New York City  | 51 °F       |

If you’d like weather data for additional cities, just let me know their names and I’ll add them to the table!<|return|>

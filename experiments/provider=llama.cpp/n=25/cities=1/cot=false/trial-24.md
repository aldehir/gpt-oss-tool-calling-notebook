<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We have a partial response: only New York City weather. The user wants weather for the following cities: "new york city" and probably others? The prompt says "Get the weather for the following cities and tabulate the results: new york city". There's only one city listed. They likely want a table with city and weather. So produce a table:

| City | Weather |

| New York City | 51°F |

But maybe they want more? The prompt ambiguous: "following cities" plural but only one listed. We'll just give table for NYC.

Return a nicely formatted table.<|end|>

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>Here’s a quick table with the requested weather information:

| City           | Current Temperature |
|----------------|----------------------|
| New York City   | 51 °F (≈ 11 °C)      |

*Note: The value is a snapshot from the most recent weather data available at the time of the query.*<|return|>

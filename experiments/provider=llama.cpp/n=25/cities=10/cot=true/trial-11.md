<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The user asks: "Get the weather for the following cities and tabulate the results: new york city, denver, chicago, austin, seattle, boston, new orleans, las vegas, los angeles, miami". Note that the list includes some duplicates or extra commas. The user wants a table. We need to call the weather function for each city. We must use the function call. Then produce a table of results.

We need to handle city names correctly: "New York City", "Denver", "Chicago", "Austin", "Seattle", "Boston", "New Orleans", "Las Vegas", "Los Angeles", "Miami". The user typed "chicago,," but we interpret as Chicago. Also "boston,," but we interpret as Boston. There is a stray comma after chicago, and a stray after boston. But we just parse.

We need to call the function for each city. Possibly we can batch but likely we need to call per city. The function get_weather expects a string city. The function returns any. We should call for each city. The function may return JSON with fields like temperature, condition, etc. We need to output a table.

We should call function get_weather for each city. That might be many calls. Let's do 10 calls. That is okay.

We should also handle errors: If function fails, we can note "Error".

We'll produce a table: City | Temperature | Condition | maybe other fields.

But we don't know the exact output format of get_weather. We'll assume it returns an object with fields: temperature, unit, condition, humidity, wind_speed, etc.

We will call function get_weather for each city, collect results, and output a markdown table.

We'll need to call function multiple times. We'll do each call.

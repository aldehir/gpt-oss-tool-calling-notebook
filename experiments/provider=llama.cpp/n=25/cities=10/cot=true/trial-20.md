We'll produce table after retrieving data. We need to call get_weather function for each city. We'll gather results. We'll then present table.

We should consider that the function returns something like JSON with weather description, temp, etc. We'll assume typical structure: { "temperature": number, "description": string, "humidity": number, "wind_speed": number, "city": string}. We'll format accordingly.

<|start|>user<|message|>Get the weather for the following cities and tabulate the results: new york city, denver, chicago, austin, seattle, boston, new orleans, las vegas, los angeles, miami<|end|>

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>User wants weather for list of cities. Need to use function get_weather. Provide table. Use function calls for each city. Use 10 or 11? list: "new york city, denver, chicago, , austin, seattle, boston, new orleans, las vegas, los angeles, miami". There's an extra comma after chicago. But we need to parse the list. We'll call get_weather for each city: "New York City", "Denver", "Chicago", "Austin", "Seattle", "Boston", "New Orleans", "Las Vegas", "Los Angeles", "Miami". Provide table. We'll need to make multiple function calls. But the policy says we can only call once? We can call multiple times. Let's do each city. We'll need to handle potential rate limits, but presumably okay. We'll produce table after retrieving data. We need to call get_weather function for each city. We'll gather results. We'll then present table.

We should consider that the function returns something like JSON with weather description, temp, etc. We'll assume typical structure: { "temperature": number, "description": string, "humidity": number, "wind_speed": number, "city": string}. We'll format accordingly.

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We got response "New York City: 51F". That's not JSON. Might be a misimplementation. It returns a string. We need to parse. It's "New York City: 51F".

For now we can just present the string as weather. But better to parse. So we need to call again for other cities.

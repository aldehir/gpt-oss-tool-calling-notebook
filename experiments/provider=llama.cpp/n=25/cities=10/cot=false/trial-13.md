<|start|>user<|message|>Get the weather for the following cities and tabulate the results: new york city, denver, chicago, austin, seattle, boston, new orleans, las vegas, los angeles, miami<|end|>

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>User wants weather for given cities. We need to use function get_weather. We will call for each city. The list: "new york city, denver, chicago, austin, seattle, boston, new orleans, las vegas, los angeles, miami" Note: There are some commas after some names, but we ignore. We need to produce tabulated results. We'll fetch weather data for each city via function calls. Then produce a table.

We'll need multiple function calls. According to policy, we can call the function multiple times. We'll do one call per city. Then assemble table. We need to produce output after function responses.

We'll produce table with columns: City, Temperature, Condition, maybe humidity. The function likely returns some structure. We don't know exactly what the function returns. We'll assume typical JSON: {temperature: ... , condition: ...}. Let's call get_weather for each city.

We'll use assistant to call function. We'll need to keep track of all responses. Then produce final answer.

We'll do function calls sequentially. We'll send a function call for "New York City", then "Denver", etc. Let's do them in order.<|end|>

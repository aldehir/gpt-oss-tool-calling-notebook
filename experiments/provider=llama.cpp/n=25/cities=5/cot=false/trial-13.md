<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to call get_weather for each city. The user lists: "new york city, denver, chicago, , austin, seattle". There's an extra comma after chicago and a blank entry. So likely the cities: New York City, Denver, Chicago, Austin, Seattle. We'll need to get weather for each. Use function get_weather. Probably we need to call for each city. The function returns any. We'll call sequentially. Then produce a table. The table maybe with columns: City, Temperature, Conditions, etc. But we only know get_weather returns something. We need to guess structure? The tool likely returns weather data. We'll call once per city.

We should handle potential errors. We'll just call get_weather for each city. Then combine into a table.

Let's do calls.<|end|>

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a table with the results. The assistant already got weather for each city via function calls. The results are strings like "New York City: 51F". We should parse these and tabulate. The order: new york city, denver, chicago, austin, seattle. We didn't get seattle yet. Need to call get_weather for Seattle. Also ensure consistent formatting: maybe two columns: City, Temperature. Use units F. Also handle any errors if function fails. Let's request for Seattle.

We should be careful: The user typed "chicago,," with double comma, but we interpreted as Chicago. Also "austin, seattle" with comma. So we should treat as list: New York City, Denver, Chicago, Austin, Seattle.

We need to call function for Seattle. Then produce a table. Let's do that.

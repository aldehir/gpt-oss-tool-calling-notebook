We need to handle 5 cities: new york city, denver, chicago, austin, seattle. We'll call the function for each. Probably we need to call once and get data for all? The function only accepts one city. So we need to call 5 times. Use the function in a single call? The function signature expects a single city. We could call multiple times. We'll output a table. Let's do that.<|end|>

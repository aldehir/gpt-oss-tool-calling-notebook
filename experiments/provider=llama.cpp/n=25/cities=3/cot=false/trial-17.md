<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>User wants weather for New York City, Denver, Chicago. Need to use function get_weather. Likely need to call function for each city. We can call the function multiple times or maybe combine. The function signature: get_weather({city: string}). We'll call for each city. Then produce a table with results. We'll need to output the table.

We should call get_weather for each city.<|end|>

Then produce a table. The table could be simple Markdown table with columns: City, Temperature. Then rows: New York City, 51F; Denver, 52F; Chicago, (response).

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a tabulated result of the weather for the cities. The assistant got the weather via function calls, returning strings like "New York City: 51F". We should parse them into a table. Provide a table with city and temperature. Use markdown table. Also maybe mention units. Also note that the data is from the function. We'll produce something like:

| City | Temperature |
|------|-------------|
| New York City | 51°F |
| Denver | 52°F |
| Chicago | 47°F |

We might also mention that these are Fahrenheit.

Return final.<|end|>

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>Here’s a quick table of the current temperatures for the requested cities:

| City           | Temperature |
|----------------|-------------|
| New York City   | 51 °F |
| Denver          | 52 °F |
| Chicago         | 47 °F |

*All values are in degrees Fahrenheit.*<|return|>

## Results

expect calls:

  "denver": 1,
  "chicago": 1

```

actual calls:
```json
{
  "new york city": 1,
  "denver": 1,
  "chicago": 1
}
```

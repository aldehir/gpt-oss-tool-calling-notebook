Likely use the function get_weather for each city. We can make three calls? The system may support only one function call at a time. But we can call function multiple times. I'll do separate calls.

We'll call get_weather with city "New York City", then "Denver", then "Chicago". We'll aggregate results into a table. We'll need to store results. We'll use the function multiple times.<|end|>

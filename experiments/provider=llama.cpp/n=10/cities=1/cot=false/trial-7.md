<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to get weather for "new york city" and produce a table. The result says 51F. Possibly also include date/time? The user asked "Get the weather for the following cities and tabulate the results: new york city". Only one city. Tabulate. Use a markdown table. Provide header maybe "City" and "Weather". Probably include "Temperature" and maybe "Condition"? Since we only have temperature. I'll create table with columns: City, Temperature. Provide 51F. Also maybe mention units. Provide a note.<|end|>

<|start|>functions.get_weather to=assistant<|channel|>commentary<|message|>"New York City: 51F"<|end|>

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We have a request: "Get the weather for the following cities and tabulate the results: new york city". The user only listed "new york city". They likely want a table. We have a response: "New York City: 51F". We should present a table. Since only one city, table with one row. Probably include columns: City, Temperature. Possibly units. Let's produce a Markdown table.

Also we can add "Current Weather" maybe. The answer we got from the function is "51F". We can present that. There's no further instruction. So respond with table.<|end|>

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>Here is the requested weather information in tabular form:

| City            | Current Temperature |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| New York City   | 51 °F (10 °C)        |

*Data retrieved via the weather function.*<|return|>

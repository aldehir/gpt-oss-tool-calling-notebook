<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The user: "Get the weather for the following cities and tabulate the results: new york city". So they want weather for "new york city". They didn't list more cities. So we just fetch weather for NYC and tabulate. We need to use the get_weather function. We'll call with city "new york city". Then format a table. Let's call function.<|end|>

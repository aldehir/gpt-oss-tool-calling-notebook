<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The user wants weather for multiple cities: New York City, Denver, Chicago, Austin, Seattle, Boston, New Orleans, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Phoenix, Portland, San Francisco, Atlanta, Dallas.

We need to use the get_weather function. We probably need to call the function for each city. But we could also call for all at once? The function signature expects a single city. So we need to call 15 times.

We need to tabulate the results. The function returns whatever data. We need to handle multiple calls and create a table. Use Markdown. We need to handle the function calls in an iterative manner. According to policy, we can call multiple times. We'll do each city and collect data. Let's do a loop mentally: We'll call get_weather for each city.

We need to produce a table: columns: City, Temperature, Weather description, maybe humidity, etc. But we don't know the output format; but typical response includes temperature, condition, maybe high/low. Let's assume the function returns a JSON with fields: temperature, description, humidity, wind_speed, etc. We'll use typical fields: "temperature", "description", "humidity", "wind_speed". We'll tabulate.

We must call each function. We'll do one by one. We'll store results. Let's start.

We'll need to output in markdown table. Let's do.

We'll start with first city: New York City. We'll call the function. Then next. We'll produce the table after all calls. Let's do.<|end|>

According to policy, we can call multiple times. We'll do each city and collect data. Let's do a loop mentally: We'll call get_weather for each city.

We need to produce a table: columns: City, Temperature, Weather description, maybe humidity, etc. But we don't know the output format; but typical response includes temperature, condition, maybe high/low. Let's assume the function returns a JSON with fields: temperature, description, humidity, wind_speed, etc. We'll use typical fields: "temperature", "description", "humidity", "wind_speed". We'll tabulate.

We must call each function. We'll do one by one. We'll store results. Let's start.

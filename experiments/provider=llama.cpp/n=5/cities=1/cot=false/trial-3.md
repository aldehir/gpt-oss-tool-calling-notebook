<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We have one city, "New York City". The user wants to get the weather for the following cities and tabulate the results. They provided only one city: "new york city". So we need to provide a table. The result from function: "New York City: 51F". But we might want to format a table with city and weather. We'll output a table. Use markdown. Provide heading: City | Weather. Then row: New York City | 51F. That is it.<|end|>

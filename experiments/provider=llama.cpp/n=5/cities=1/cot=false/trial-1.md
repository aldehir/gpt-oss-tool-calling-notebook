<|start|>functions.get_weather to=assistant<|channel|>commentary<|message|>"New York City: 51F"<|end|>

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The user asked: "Get the weather for the following cities and tabulate the results: new york city". They only provided one city. They want a tabulation. We have weather from function: "New York City: 51F". We need to produce a table. Possibly with columns like City, Temperature. So produce a table with one row.

We should be mindful: The function returned a string "New York City: 51F". We should parse that. The city is "New York City", temperature 51F. Let's produce a markdown table.

Answer: Provide a table.<|end|>

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Weather Summary**

| City           | Temperature |
|----------------|-------------|
| New York City  | 51 °F        |

*Note: Temperature is based on the most recent data retrieved for New York City.*<|return|>

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The user asks: "Get the weather for the following cities and tabulate the results: new york city". They mention "the following cities" but only list "new york city". Probably they want a table with the weather for NYC. We'll need to call get_weather function for "New York City".

We need to call the function. Then respond with a table. The function returns JSON. We'll need to parse that. The function signature: get_weather takes city string and returns any. We'll call it.<|end|>

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We got a simple response: "New York City: 51F". The function output seems to be a string. We'll need to parse into a table: City | Temperature. The table might include column headings: City, Temperature. We'll produce markdown table. Since we only have one city, we can show that.

We should respond with the table.

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>Here’s the current weather for the requested city:

| New York City   | 51 °F       |

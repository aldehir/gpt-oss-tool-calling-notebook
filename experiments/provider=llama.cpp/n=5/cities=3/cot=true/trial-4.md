We'll return a table with columns: City, Temperature, Conditions, Humidity, etc. The function output unknown but likely JSON with fields like temperature, weather, humidity, etc. We can call the function for each city.

But we only have temperature. Condition unknown. We can leave blank or "N/A". We'll use the data. Let's present.<|end|>

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Current Weather Snapshot**

| Denver          | 52 °F | N/A | N/A |
| Chicago         | 47 °F | N/A | N/A |

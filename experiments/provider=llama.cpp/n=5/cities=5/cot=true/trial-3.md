<|start|>assistant<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to call the function get_weather for each city: "new york city", "denver", "chicago", "austin", "seattle". We'll need to handle comma after chicago? The list is "new york city, denver, chicago, austin, seattle". Note that there's an extra comma after chicago, but we parse into five cities. We'll call function for each. Then produce a table.

We have to use the function get_weather. We can call it multiple times. There's no limitation? We can call function per city. We'll produce a table with city and weather. Possibly include temperature, condition? We need to see what the function returns. The function returns any. We'll assume it returns some JSON with temperature, conditions, etc.

We'll produce table as Markdown.
